        <h3>1. What is the research study about?</h3>
        <p>The research study aims to explore employees’ emotional displays at work and related attitudes and well-being. You are invited to take part in this research study because you have registered on Prolific, which is the platform via which this study is conducted.</p>

        <h3>2. Who are conducting this research?</h3>
        <p>The study is being carried out by the following researchers: Professor Xie at the Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto; Professor Lam at Alliance Manchester Business School, The University of Manchester; Professor Chen at College of Business, Law and Social Sciences, University of Derby; and Dr. Tang at Zhongnan University of Economics and Law. This research is being funded by a grant from Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and Magna Professorship Grant from University of Toronto.</p>

        <h3>3. Do I have to take part in this research study?</h3>
        <p>Participation in this research study is entirely voluntary. If you do not want to take part, you do not have to. If you decide to take part in the research study, you will be asked to:</p>
        <p>• Read the instruction and each question carefully; and</p>
        <p>• Complete the online questionnaire (answer each of the questions).</p>

        <h3>4. What does participation in this research require, and are there any risks involved?</h3>
        <p>
            The questionnaire will take approximately XX minutes to complete. As a “thank you” for your time, you will be rewarded with £ X (English sterling pound if you are in UK) or $ X (if you are in Canada) for your participation in the survey.
            This amount of payment is according to the recommended pay rate on Prolific. Please note that the survey has attention check questions. Correctly answering the attention check questions is a precondition for you to receive the payment.

        <h3>5. What are the possible benefits to participation?</h3>
        <p>
            We hope to use information we get from this research study to benefit others who read our research findings. We hope the readers will benefit from understanding what other employees are doing at work and their feelings about their work so that they can benchmark their own feelings and behaviors.
